* This updates the existing FSA package on CRAN.

* This addresses concerns that will be caused by a (near) future version of `testthat` (per e-mail from the maintainer of that package).  I have made the necessary changes to fix those concerns and have tested them with the latest development version of `testthat`.

## Notes
* There was a note about a possible misspelling of "fishR".  This is not a misspelling.

* On CRAN, there were notes in the previous version about a missing `RMark` package for the "r-patched-solaris-sparc" and "r-patched-solaris-x86" flavors.  Again (as with the previous version), I am not sure what to do about this note.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.

* Win Builder -- current and development.
