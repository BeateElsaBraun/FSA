* This is an update to the existing FSA package on CRAN.

* This update addresses the concern expressed by CRAN (Maechler e-mail on 13-Feb) about the future deprecation of `package.dependencies()`.  This package no longer uses `package.dependencies()`.

* Other changes in this update are noted in the NEWS.md file.

* This update passed the release and development versions on win-builder.

* Additionally there were notes about a missing RMark package for the "r-patched-solaris-sparc" and "r-patched-solaris-x86" flavors.  Again (as with the previous version), I am not sure what to do about this note.
