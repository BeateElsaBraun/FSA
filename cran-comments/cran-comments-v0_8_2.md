* This is an update to an existing package.

* It passed the release and development versions on win-builder.

* Upon confirming submission there was an error for the "r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64" flavor that appeared to be related to missing gdata and testthat packages.  I am not sure what to do about this because the package did pass the win-builder tests for both the release and development versions of R.

* Additionally there were notes about a missing RMark package for the "r-patched-solaris-sparc" and "r-patched-solaris-x86" flavors.  Again, I am not sure what to do about these notes.
