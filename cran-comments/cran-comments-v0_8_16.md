* This is a resubmission for an update of the existing FSA package on CRAN. The first submission errored in what appears to be a false positive. I was told to resubmit and if the problem occurred again to ask to have it checked manually.

## Notes
* There is a note about "fishR" being misspelled in the description. This is not a misspelling.
* On [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/), there were notes in the previous version about a missing `RMark` package for the "r-patched-solaris-x86" flavor. Again (as with the previous versions), I am not sure what to do about this note.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- old-release, release, and development.
* Travis-CI and AppVeyor.
