ToDo list

o bcFuns() -- need details in help file.

o dietOverlap -- need details in help file.

o growthModelSim() -- check vbOriginalW (does not seem to respond properly to changes in b), make the sliders depenent for the situations where lengths are declared (Francis, Schnute) so that the smaller length cannot exceed the larger length and vice versa.

o ks2d() ... make one common function for the 1-sample and 2-sample versions.  Do this after you confirm that you are getting correct results.

o srSim() et al -- add the Schaeffer model.

o Create a estimateM() where the user can estimate M from growth history traits with a variety of methods (e.g., Pauly (1980), Hoenig, Hewitt and Hoenig (2005), etc.).  Some of these are coded in fishMethods and some on Hoenigs webpage.
